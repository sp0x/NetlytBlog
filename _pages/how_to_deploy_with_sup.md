Nowdays if you want to use CI/CD in your project, you can either use something like Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI, GoCD.
But what if you have a private project that's hosted on a google/amazon instance and you don't want to setup any of the previous tools?
*Sup* is a great tool that can help you out with that.
